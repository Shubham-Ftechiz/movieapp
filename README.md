# movieapp

## I have done this movie app assignment.In this movie app I have use React, Ant Design ,NodeJs, multer for
uploading image and MongoDb, I have provided validation in login page for email and
password and also for routes if user is does not logged in and they try to login then they will redirect to login screen,
same if user logged in and they try to change the routes like "/" or "/login" it will remain in the same screen like "/dashboard",
once you logged in it will redirect user in landing page that is dashboard where you can create movies I have also added delete functionality
by which user can delete the created movie, user can create movie by uploding an image and it will show in dashboard,
after creating movie they can logout from logout button
